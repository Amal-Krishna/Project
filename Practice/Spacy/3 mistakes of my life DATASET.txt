He kicked the boy's face with his knee and released him. The boy kneeled on the floor and sucked in air.
The last kick from Ish had smeared the blood from his nose across his face.
'And what do you think you are doing?' Ish's dad asked him.
'Teaching him a lesson,' Ish said and unhooked his bat stuck in the
windscreen.

We still come here sometimes, but now we prefer the abandoned bank branch
compound near my home.
A tennis ball landed at my feet. A sweaty twelve-year-old boy came running to
me. I picked up the ball for him. Nana Park is where I had first met Ishaan and
Omi, over fifteen years ago. There was no dramatic moment that marked the start
of our friendship. Maybe we sized each other up as the only six-year-olds in the
ground and started playing together.
Like most neighbourhood kids, we went to the Belrampur Municipal School,
hundred metres down Nana Park. Of course, only I studied while Ish and Omi ran
to the park at every opportunity.
Three bicycles tried to overtake each other in the narrow by lane. I had to step
inside Qazi restaurant to let them pass. A scent of fried coriander and garlic filled
the narrow room. The cook prepared dinner, a bigger feast than usual as India
had won the match. Ishaan and I came here sometimes (without telling Omi, of
course) for the cheap food and extraordinary mutton. The owner assured us
'small mutton', implying goat and not beef. I believed him, as he would not have
survived in the neighbourhood if he served beef. I wanted to eat here instead of
Gopi. But we had promised Gopi to Omi, and the food was fantastic there as well.
Food is a passion here, especially as Gujarat is a dry state. People here get drunk
on food.
