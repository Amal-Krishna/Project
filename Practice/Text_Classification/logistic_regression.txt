logistic regression is used for binary classification
it is a core topic in ML

point concept of logistic regression is used here

 Each sentence is mapped to a point
 
 each document in the dataset is given point(value calculated based on its feature values)
 this point value detrmines whether the document is +ve or -ve
 
 
 If the point is greater than 0.5 then positive else negative.

Logistic Regression – Learning algorithm

     A learning algorithm is a specific type of algorithm whose
    performance increases with time. Logistic regression is a type of
    learning algorithm. It learns from a training dataset, the pattern of
    the data and applies the learned logics on new data for prediction.

    
Logistic Regression – Linear Equation

        Consider the equation:

                    y = a + bx1 + cx2 + ⋯ + dx2000

                                                a, b, c, d = coefficients

                                                X1, X2, ..., X2000 = independent variables /features
    
                                                y = dependent variable

                                                
    The task the learning algorithm does is that it learns from the training dataset                ## coefficients are caluated by gradient descent
    by adjusting the value of coefficients
    
    the algorithm optimises the value of these coefficients that it can predict accurately for documents in testing dataset
    
    
    
Logistic Regression – Predicting Sentiment
    
                If y >= 0.5 → Positive sentiment
    
                If y < 0.5 → Negative sentiment
                
                
        For some values of the dependent variables, the value of y can be > 1 or < 0.
        in this case the value of y is resticted between the range 0-1(normalisation)


        
        
        
        For y > 0,
                        y = e(a+bx1+cx2+⋯+dx2000)

        For y < 1,
                         y = e(a+bx1+cx2+⋯+dx2000) / e (a+bx1+cx2+⋯+dx2000) + 1
                         
        
        simplyfying,
                        ln( y / y−1 ) = a + bx1 + cx2 + ⋯ + dx2000




Logistic Regression – Graph
                
                
                A Graph is plotted feature-probablity
                
                the points of documents in test dataset is mapped to it
                
                draw perpendicular lines from points to the graph 
                
                find the probality from y-axis corresponding to the point of intersection of line on graph
                
                if point probablity value is greater than 0.5 it is +ve otherwise -ve
