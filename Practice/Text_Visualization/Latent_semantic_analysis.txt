Another model used in nlp for semantic analysis of a text/article/document

this relates a document to a particular concept

LSA is technique of analysing relationship between set of documents and terms they contain and forming a set of concepts related to the document/terms

lsa is use for article classification - to classify to different groups

lsa model is formed by transforming from BOW model

lsa is based on the mathematical concept of SVD
    according to svd any given matrix can be represeneted as product of three matrices
    
    A[m*n] = U[m*r] * S[r*r] * (V[n*r])^T               #### m = no of documents, n = no of words/features
    
    
    U  - left singular matrix ## m - no of documents, r = no of concepts
    
    s -  rank matrix , ###r - rank of A (diagonal matrix)
    
    V - right singular matrix   ## n - no of words/features , r - no of concepts
    
    
lsa -Applications
     article bucketing in websites
     
     finding relations btw articles/words
     
     page indexing in search engines
     
     
google uses lsa for page ranking. google stores a large number of keywords associated with each topic in its database
when user searches the websites containing most of the words in its database is given highest rank and shown first
